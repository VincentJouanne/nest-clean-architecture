# On-site food ordering

We want to provide to people a way to order food, on-site, directly from their phone so they have immediately access to the menu, discounts and can place orders without waiting for the waiter or stand in line.

Restaurants can create one Menu in which they can add Sections (Snacks, Drinks etc.), Sub-Sections (Alcohol, Alochol-free etc.) and Products (Mojito, Pina Colada etc.).

Customers can browse the Menu and place orders.

Once an order is placed, the restaurant is notified and can take the order and then inform the customer its order is ready and on its way.
